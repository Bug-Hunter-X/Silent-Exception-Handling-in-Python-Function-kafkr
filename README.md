This repository demonstrates an example of a Python function that handles exceptions silently and a solution to improve its error handling. The original function lacks specific information about failures, while the improved version includes detailed logging and messages for better debugging.

The `bug.py` file shows the original function with inadequate error handling. The `bugSolution.py` file presents an improved version that addresses these issues.

This example highlights the importance of providing detailed error information in production code for effective debugging and maintenance.
